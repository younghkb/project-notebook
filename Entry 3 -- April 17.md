# Design notebook for week ending April 17, 2016

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critque you
received for last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did
the feedback help improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer
something you hadn't considered? Did it help you make a design decision? Was it 
helpful in addressing the most pressing issues in your project? How will you
incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you change something about the 
design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

In the last critique, Amit focused on the types of things that would be useful 
to be able to do as a user. He focused on two of the key design things
that I've been thinking through, which is precedence and the definition of neutrality.
I agree that these are pretty important issues to work through. However, I didn't 
address them as much this week because I wanted to get more into the coding details
and focus less on the design aspect. For next week's work, I'll make this more of 
a priority again.

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

This week, I went more into the technical details. I decided to switch the language
in which I'm working, from python and vpython to js, html, and a js 3d framework 
called three. I decided to make this shift because I did not like the gui options
available with python. For the level I want to customize things, it did not look
like there was a fast way to do so in Python. However, I've done web dev before and
I know I can whip up a decent interface pretty quickly in that set up. Also, I was able
to find good humanoid examples in three, which makes it more accessible. 

I did not put as much time into the design of the language itself, because of trying to get going 
on the prototyping-type work. Next week will be about pulling those two pieces back together.



## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
