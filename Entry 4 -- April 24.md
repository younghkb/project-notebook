# Design notebook for week ending April 24, 2016

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critque you
received for last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did
the feedback help improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer
something you hadn't considered? Did it help you make a design decision? Was it 
helpful in addressing the most pressing issues in your project? How will you
incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you change something about the 
design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

It was gratifying to hear that Josh agrees with my switch to JS. I was pretty
sure that this was the best approach to take, but having someone confirm it is
reassuring. His comments about how the 3D realism can affect the enjoyability of
using this language are also valuable insights. I'm still working out the details
of how this will work, but it is useful to know what sorts of models people
respond well to. 

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

This week, I made a lot of progress on getting a nice mockup of the interface.
While I want to make some revisions to improve use, it's a good start as for
how I want my user to interact with the language. During this process, it was
helpful to draw out of lot of my ideas on paper before starting coding. This
helped me to visual which things actually could be nice to work with and which
elements would be too messy. I also put together the 
presentation. I've been working on the 3D animation, but that's still pretty
difficult. It looks like I'm prolly just gonna try to reverse engineer some
examples I've found online, because it's not like this is a topic for which 
a ton of tutorials exist. 


## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

Getting the 3D animation decently working is probably the most critical part of 
my project at this point. I have some more clean up tasks in other areas, and
obviously once I get that, I'll have to do some work on the IR and general 
connections. However, the 3D part is still the most nebulus in how it is going
to work out. 

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

Given that we're not meeting anymore, not sure that this is relevant. However, I
could still user testing as I complete my project. Since I live down the hall from
Josh, maybe I'll see if I can bug him into doing this.

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**

Probably around 10-11? Not entirely sure, but I did an extra push because I really
wanted to get the interface cleaned up for demoing.
