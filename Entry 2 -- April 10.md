# Design notebook for week ending April 10, 2016

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critique you
received for last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did
the feedback help improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer
something you hadn't considered? Did it help you make a design decision? Was it 
helpful in addressing the most pressing issues in your project? How will you
incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you change something about the 
design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

I think that Josh made a good point about developing the two sides of the gui 
simultaneously is important. I don't wanna just do one and then get to the other 
and realize I forgot some hugely important feature. Developing them side-by-side
should help decrease this risk. He also brought up some questions about the
timing aspect of this, which to be honest I don't have ay idea how to address. 
He also mentioned prioritizing ease of use and extensibility, which I totally
agree with. I think keeping in mind what keeps my language different from
labanotation is a good way to evaluate what my progress has been in developing
a language.

## Description

**TODO:** Fill in this part with information about your work this week:
important design decisions, changes to previous decisions, open questions,
exciting milestones, preliminary results, etc. Feel free to include images
(e.g., a sketch of the design or a screenshot of a running program), links to
code, and any other resources that you think will help clearly convey your
design process.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
