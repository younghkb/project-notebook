## Notes from "Introduction to Labanotation" 
(http://user.uni-frankfurt.de/~griesbec/LABANE.HTML)


### Staff
* Used to represent which part of the body (left, right, or middle)
* Where transference of weight and gesture initiation is indicated
* The staff tells which direction the movement should be read

### Time, direction signs, position signs
* There needs to be a way to determine the length of the movement
* Indications of which direction the movement is (l, r, forward, back, up, down, and combinations)
* Relationships of the movement to eachother (still the same as directions, but relative rather than absolute)

### Arm and leg gestures
* "Gestures, as mentioned earlier, are all movements of parts of the body which carry no weight"
* Specific parts of the foot touching the ground (whole foot, pad, toes, etc)

### Center of weight and transference of weight
* Which part of body has the center of weight
* Do weight transfers occurs
* Jumps, turns (how the weight is transferred)

### Body parts
* what it sounds like...
* This could get super specific or not super specific

### Quantity signs
* Something to indicate how much space the motion should take up (kinesphere)
* Dyanamics of the movement (effort qualities)
* Key signatures--global truths for the movement (like feet are always turned out, or arms default to a position)

### Bows
* Indicate which movements are simultaneous
* Addressing someone, being near something, touching something, supporting weight on something

### Paths, floor plans
* what sort of path you're making through space (circle, straight line, squiggly thing)
