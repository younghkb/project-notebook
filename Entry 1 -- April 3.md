# Design notebook for week ending April 3, 2016

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critque you
received for last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did
the feedback help improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer
something you hadn't considered? Did it help you make a design decision? Was it 
helpful in addressing the most pressing issues in your project? How will you
incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you change something about the 
design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

## Description

March 30, 2015 - 1.25 hrs (in class work session):

I started collecting resources about labanotation to get a better sense of the domain. This website has a really useful overview:
http://user.uni-frankfurt.de/~griesbec/LABANE.HTML . If you're trying to get a sense of what labanoation can do, I would recommend
giving this a quick skim. There's also a book at the library that looks useful: _Labanotation: The System of Analyzing and Recording Movement_ By Ann Hutchinson. I'll try to pick it up today on my way to Modern. I also made a note page regarding key concepts in Labanotation that I could work with. Also, wow is the guy who wrote the Labanotation introduction salty: "The language of the human body is complex and it will not be possible to do a satisfying simulation of it using computers before computer scientists give up their rough simplifications in simulation and notation of movement and use the experiences collected in the last seventy years (and the centurys before) in dance notation and make them their own." I started on the design_and_implementation document.

April 2, 2015 - 1.25 hrs
I took notes on _Laban for All_, which can be found in a file of that name in this repository. It was actually really good for covering a lot of the typical uses of Laban's work (the effort affinities, drives, etc), which I thought would be useful to review to understand typical use cases of the language. 

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
