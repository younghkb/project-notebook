# Design notebook for week ending April 3, 2016

## Last week's critique

**TODO:** Fill in this part with a summary and reflection on the critque you
received for last week's work. Answer questions such as:  How, specifically, did
the feedback help improve the project? Did the feedback point out or offer
something you hadn't considered? Did it help you make a design decision? Was it 
helpful in addressing the most pressing issues in your project? How will you
incorporate the feedback into your work? Will you change something about the 
design, implementation, or evaluation as a result?

## Description

March 30, 2015 - 1.25 hrs (in class work session):

I started collecting resources about labanotation to get a better sense of the domain. This website has a really useful overview:
http://user.uni-frankfurt.de/~griesbec/LABANE.HTML . If you're trying to get a sense of what labanoation can do, I would recommend
giving this a quick skim. There's also a book at the library that looks useful: Labanotation: The System of Analyzing and Recording Movement By Ann Hutchinson. I'll try to pick it up today on my way to Modern. I also started making a note page regarding key concepts in Labanotation that I could work with.

## Questions

**What is the most pressing issue for your project? What design decision do
you need to make, what implementation issue are you trying to solve, or how
are you evaluating your design and implementation?**

**What questions do you have for your critique partners? How can they best help
you?**

**How much time did you spend on the project this week? If you're working in a
team, how did you share the labor?**
