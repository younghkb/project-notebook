## Notes on _Laban for All_ by Jean Newlove and John Dalby 

### My thoughts
* This book is less about the specific notation and more about the uses of Laban to understand how we move
* Think it's useful from a understanding the use cases point of view--what efforts and directions people are likely to combine, etc.
* This book actually does a really good job of covering the concepts without getting lost in details

### Core ideas
* Kinesphere - personal bubble around a person extending as far as they can reach in any direction 
* Levels - there are three, high medium, and deep. High is above the head, medium is around the waist, and deep is towards the feet.
* Counter-tension - one body part provides tension in opposition to another. For ex, leg and arm reaching opposite directions
* The dimensional planes:
    * Door Plane - High to deep dimension, aka the vertical plane
    * Wheel Plane - Forward to back dimension, aka the sagital plane
    * Table Plan - Right to left dimension, aka the horizontal plane
* Space - can interact with space by either gathering (bringing into ourselves) or scattering (throwing away from ourselves)
* Time - duh
* Weight - light to strong, the balancing of tension in the body
* Flow - free flow to bound blow, is the movement constricted or allowed to breathe

### The Eight Basic Efforts
* Pressing
* Flicking
* Wringing
* Dabbing
* Slashing
* Gliding
* Thursting
* Floating
