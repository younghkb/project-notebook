## Notes on _Laban for All_ by Jean Newlove and John Dalby 

### My thoughts
* This book is less about the specific notation and more about the uses of Laban to understand how we move
* Think it's useful from a understanding the use cases point of view--what efforts and directions people are likely to combine, etc.
* This book actually does a really good job of covering the concepts without getting lost in details
* I could definitely go in a lot deeper on effort than I'm currently going

### Core ideas
* Kinesphere - personal bubble around a person extending as far as they can reach in any direction 
* Levels - there are three, high medium, and deep. High is above the head, medium is around the waist, and deep is towards the feet.
* Counter-tension - one body part provides tension in opposition to another. For ex, leg and arm reaching opposite directions
* The dimensional planes:
    * Door Plane - High to deep dimension, aka the vertical plane
    * Wheel Plane - Forward to back dimension, aka the sagital plane
    * Table Plan - Right to left dimension, aka the horizontal plane
* Space - can interact with space by either gathering (bringing into ourselves) or scattering (throwing away from ourselves)
    * Two elements: direct and indirect
* Time - duh   
    * Two elements: sudden and sustained
* Weight - light to strong, the balancing of tension in the body
    * Two elements: strong and light
* Flow - free flow to bound blow, is the movement constricted or allowed to breathe
* Effort graph - relates weight, flow, time, and space
* Grades of intensity - weight, flow, time, space can be graded as normal, or more less intense than normal

### The Eight Basic Efforts & Affinities (relates space, time, and weight)
* Pressing - Direct, sustained, strong (left deep back)
* Flicking - Indirect, sudden, light (right high back)
* Wringing - Indirect, sustained, strong (right deep front)
* Dabbing - Direct, sudden, light (left high back)
* Slashing - Sudden, strong, indirect (right deep back)
* Gliding - Sustained, light, direct (left high front)
* Thrusting - Direct, sudden, strong (left deep front)
* Floating - Indirect, sustained, light (right high front)

### The Four Drives
* How we display inner attitude
* Action - Awake mode, near mode, or stable mode (space time and weight)
* Vision - Awake mode, remote mode, mobile mode (space time and flow)
* Spell - Dream mode, remote mode, stable mode (space weight and flow)
* Passion - Dream mode, near mode, mobile mode (time weight and flow)
